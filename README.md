This repository is just for any letter combination's searching and throwing a light on remembering word groups of the some root.  
e.g.:
* How can I find all words ending with 'ist'?
* How can I find all words with 'pend' in it?  

As we all know, apps and online dictionaries can only be searched by some start letters in a word. When it comes to the ends or the middles of one word, no extant access can already do that yet.  Here comes the solvent.
>Open the file `root.py` and change the value of `root` in the first line to what you want to search and then run it.   
You can find the result in the roots folder.

## File Structure
* `glossary.txt` comes from folder `scr`.   
* * The txt files in 'scr' were downloaded from online web. 
* * The py file generates the file  'glossary.txt', then take some regex replacements.
* `root.py` takes the role for searching. Results will be in the folder `roots`.  
>Don't delete `root.py` and `glossary.txt`. As for others, just do whatever as you like.

## Words Remembering
